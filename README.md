2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Have faced some diffuclties in Guess Function. I have tried to solve it by my ownself but faced issue in counting progress. So then I took help from the codepath Documentation.Then I have solved it.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[What If we need to host this game and make it live for public? What we need to do for that?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
